# 64-bit alert:
FireCryptEx loads volumes into RAM for encryption, and as it often needs more than 2GB of RAM for larger volumes, and because RAM is extremely limited on 32-bit systems, these two versions of FireCryptEx are available only on 64-bit systems.

# FireCryptEx - Mono
A special edition of FireCryptEx that runs on Mono (Windows, OS X, Linux)
This version is an addition to the same author's FireCryptEx, which is alternatively hosted on GitLab.

# FireCryptEx

The successor to FireCrypt.

Lots of new features, new UI, fresh updates.

Stay tuned, and contribute!
